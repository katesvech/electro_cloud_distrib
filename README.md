# Cloud and Lightning Discharge Analysis from Satellite Data
This repository contains code for analyzing features of clouds and lightning discharges based on satellite data. The project is focused on leveraging geospatial data to understand cloud dynamics and lightning events through statistical methods.
## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze patterns in the properties of clouds and lightning discharges, using satellite data. This includes tasks like:
- Statistical analysis of the number of discharges per one cloud with other parameters of the cloud, including size, shape, and density characterized by TBB.
- Comparing features of clouds and discharges in all the satellite footprint, in separate "chimneys", and in the region within the Aragats research station.
- Visualizing clouds and lightning centers on maps.
- Possible application of identified patterns to forecasting methods.
### Current Features
1. **Cloud Filtering**: A function that filters clouds based on whether they stay within a geographic bounding box.
2. **Lightning Discharge Counting**: Scripts to analyze the number of lightning discharges per cloud.
3. **Visualization**: Mapping cloud centers and bounding boxes using Plotly for interactive geospatial visualization.
### Planned Features
- Detailed statistical analysis of cloud and lightning data.
- Visualization enhancements and region-specific analysis.
